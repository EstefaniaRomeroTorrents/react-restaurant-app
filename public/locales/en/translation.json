  "histoire.histoire.text": "Created by Jean Minchelli at the end of the 1960s, a man of the sea and a friend of all Paris in vogue, Le Duc was part of the New Culinary Wave that was to sweep across France: breaking with the dogmas of traditional and bourgeois cuisine , the restaurant dares to use natural simplicity, reducing the quantity of sauces and cooking time to gain flavor and lightness. It is here that the first fish served raw appeared, unheard of then! This very modern kitchen ensures the 'Duke' longevity and modernity. Signed Slavik, the original decor tinged with sea spray anchors the place in a timeless chic."
