    "textproductos": "Since its creation, quality and freshness have been the keywords of this high standing establishment. Fish, shellfish and crustaceans come from the French coast, taken out of the water by small fishermen. The menu follows the tides and the seasons, to offer only the best arrivals: Breton lobster, Belon oysters or sea bass stand out for the simplicity of the preparations and the precision of the kitchen. As for spices and aromatic herbs, they know how to reveal the true nature of these unique products, whether they are luxurious like turbot or popular like sardines.",

Dominique Minchelli assisted by Pascal Hélard and Senthuran Vignesvaran in the kitchen ensures that the family spirit and modernity go hand in hand.
